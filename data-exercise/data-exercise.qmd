Placeholder file for the future Tidy Tuesday exercise.

###Load necessary libraries
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```
###Set seed for reproducibility
```{r}
set.seed(123)
```
###Generate synthetic data
```{r}
n <- 1000
```

```{r}
age <- round(runif(n, 22, 65), 0)
education_levels <- c("High School", "Bachelor's", "Master's", "PhD")
education <- sample(education_levels, n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1))
```

###Assign numeric values to education levels for income calculation
```{r}
education_num <- as.numeric(factor(education, levels = education_levels))

# Assign numeric values to education levels for income calculation
education_num <- as.numeric(factor(education, levels = education_levels))

income <- round(30000 + age * 1000 + education_num * 10000 + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 5000), 0)
hours_worked <- round(40 - age * 0.1 + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 5), 1)
job_satisfaction <- round(5 + income * 0.0001 - hours_worked * 0.05 + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1), 1)
```
##Create a data frame
```{r}
data <- data.frame(age, education, income, hours_worked, job_satisfaction)
```
###Explore data by making plots and tables
```{r}
summary(data)
```

###Plot relationships
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = age, y = income)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  labs(title = "Income vs Age")

ggplot(data, aes(x = education, y = income)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Income by Education Level")

ggplot(data, aes(x = age, y = hours_worked)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  labs(title = "Hours Worked vs Age")

ggplot(data, aes(x = income, y = job_satisfaction)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  labs(title = "Job Satisfaction vs Income")

ggplot(data, aes(x = hours_worked, y = job_satisfaction)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  labs(title = "Job Satisfaction vs Hours Worked")
```
###Fit simple models to the data
```{r}
model_income <- lm(income ~ age + education, data = data)
summary(model_income)

model_hours <- lm(hours_worked ~ age, data = data)
summary(model_hours)

model_satisfaction <- lm(job_satisfaction ~ income + hours_worked, data = data)
summary(model_satisfaction)
```
###Explore different models
```{r}
model_satisfaction_glm <- glm(job_satisfaction ~ income + hours_worked, family = gaussian(link = "identity"), data = data)
summary(model_satisfaction_glm)
```
